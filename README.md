# StegoPay — Wallet


Steganography is a technique of hiding secret data such as text, images, videos, or files within an image, video, text, or file. This project is a unique payment gateway designed to help users safely conduct online transactions by hiding their encrypted card details with the use of a user-selected image. This can be achieved by using a coverless image steganography method, as the cover image is not modified in any way and is therefore resistant to steganalysis attacks. The coverless image steganography technique that we developed is based on the concept of mapping. This technique provides freedom to the user to select any cover image to map their card details with. The project consists of an Android wallet application and a full-stack web application. The Android application will allow users to choose an image to map their card details with (the card number, expiration date, and CVV), which will result in what is called a ‘stego-card’. Users can then use this stego-card to make online transactions securely. This eliminates the need of entering details every time the user wants to make a digital purchase as well as provides an extra layer of security to the user’s financial information.
